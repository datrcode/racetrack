**\n** Critical List\n**

** Need to replace CSV parser with library so that it handles excel... // 2013-03-08
** ... also need to add UI for users to select scalars, timestamps, and tags
** ... should probably fingerprint the headers once the user selects so that it doesn't need to be done again
** Need to remember windows, window positions, and component settings // 2013-03-17
** ... should probably be prioritized by datasource (filename) and then by tablet headers (sorted)
** ... should recall when application first loads up and data becomes available
** ... should periodically save to the RT Store both by datassource and by tablet headers (sorted)
** Need to automatically store and recall entity tags, time markers when SQLList is avilable // 2013-03-17
** Issue with RTGraph when the count for a link equals zero - the link is not displayed, but set operations cause nullpointer // 2013-03-21

** Need GraphInfo in RTGraph to depict commonalities with selected nodes // 2013-03-23
** Need to be able to recursively decompose elements http://www.cnn.com => www.cnn.com => 1.2.3.4 => US
** ... Currently, decomposition is limited to just one level to avoid infinite recursion
** ...    For example www.cnn.com => 1.2.3.4 => www.cnn.com => 1.2.3.4...
** ... Need RTGraph option to decompose a field down into the graph elements
** Filtering mode in RTGraphPanel is still twitchy especially when filtering specific edges/nodes // 2013-03-24
** ... Seems related to how the no mapping set is used or perhaps when a null value is returned from the shapeBundles
